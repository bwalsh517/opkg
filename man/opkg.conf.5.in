.SH NAME
opkg.conf \- opkg configuration file
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This file contains default options for opkg. Each line contains a
single option which is exactly the same as a normal command line
option for opkg except for the leading dashes which are not used
here. Comments are allowed by starting a line with a hash sign
("\fB#\fR").
.P
There can be multiple configuration files.  Repositories can be
placed in separate *.conf files.  A repository configuration
file needs only a \fBsrc\fb line.
.P
A opkg.conf file is not needed if repositories are not being used to
obtain packages and if the packages are expected to install in "/".

.SH REPOSITORY CONFIGURATION
The opkg repository configuration consists of three parts.

The repository type, the repository name, and the repository location.
The repository type is used to indicate what format the repository will take.
\fBsrc\fP will take the form of an uncompress repository list, while \fBsrc/gz\fP will take the form of a gzip compress repository list.

The repository name is a descriptive name used to identify a particular repository.
For instance \fBbase\fP may refer to a basic repository containing packages used for generic maintanace.
A repository named \fBnightly\fP may contain packages from some daily build system.

The third part consists of the repository location.
This must point to the top directory containing the \fBPackages\fP index file.
The repository location may refer to a local directory on the system with the prefix \fBfile://\fP, or to a webserver with \fBhttp://\fP\fBhttps://\fP, or to an FTP server with \fBftp://\fP.
